## Dependencies

- Conky Manager

Conky Manager Installation (Ubuntu, Linux Mint etc):

If you are using Ubuntu or its other derivatives you can install it from the Launchpad PPA. Builds are available for the following Ubuntu releases:
- 13.10 (saucy)
- 14.04 (trusty)
- 14.10 (utopic)

To install from PPA, type the following commands one by one in a terminal window:
```
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:teejee2008/ppa
sudo apt-get update`
sudo apt-get install conky-manager
```

Updates will be installed automatically if you have enabled automatic updates enabled on your system. The package can also be updated manually by running the install command again.

Now that you're done with the installations, the next thing you want to do is to download the ![Iron Main Wallpaper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naumanafsar/jarvis-live-wallpaper/master/imgs/iron-man.jpg) and set it as your Desktop Photo.

Now go to the *src* Directory and copy the *conkyrc* file and paste it in your *.conky* directory!
Now open *Conky Manager* and select the *conkyrc* file, Enjoy :)
